Index Tab
---------

 Index Tab is a 6x13 ortho keyboard. Tried to make it look like index tab that are used as dividers in drawers and
 ring binders. The reason for 13 in width instead of 12 is that I’m Norwegian, and neeed that added row for `æøå`.

 You can play around with the layout over at [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/2577189f7cf19d980fff8177d14dc3ec).
